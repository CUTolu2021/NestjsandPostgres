## Description
This project is a scalable user entity management system built using the NestJS framework. The system revolves around the User entity, which represents an individual user with various attributes and properties. The project provides a comprehensive set of APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) user entities, as well as retrieving and manipulating user data.

User Entity
The User entity is the core of this project, representing an individual user with the following attributes:

id: A unique identifier for the user, automatically generated by the system.
firstName: The user's first name.
lastName: The user's last name.
email: The user's email address, which must be unique and valid.
isActive: A boolean indicating whether the user is active or not.
APIs
The project provides the following APIs for managing user entities:

Create User
POST /user: Creates a new user entity with the provided data.
Request Body: CreateUserDto object containing firstName, lastName, email, and isActive properties.
Response: The newly created user entity with its generated id.
Read User
GET /user: Retrieves a list of all user entities.
Response: An array of User entities.
GET /user/:id: Retrieves a single user entity by its id.
Response: The user entity with the specified id.
Update User
PATCH /user/:id: Updates an existing user entity with the provided data.
Request Body: UpdateUserDto object containing firstName, lastName, email, and isActive properties.
Response: The updated user entity.
Delete User
DELETE /user/:id: Deletes a user entity by its id.
Response: The deleted user entity.
Validation and Error Handling
The project uses the class-validator library to validate user input data and ensure that it conforms to the expected format. The system also implements error handling mechanisms to catch and handle any errors that may occur during API requests.

Dependencies
The project relies on the following dependencies:

@nestjs/common: Provides the core functionality for building NestJS applications.
@nestjs/typeorm: Enables the use of TypeORM for database operations.
class-validator: Provides validation functionality for user input data.
@nestjs/swagger: Generates API documentation using Swagger.
